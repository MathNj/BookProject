# Specification Quality Checklist: Module 1 - The Robotic Nervous System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-30
**Feature**: [specs/002-nervous-system-ros2/spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All items completed. Specification is ready for planning phase.

### Key Strengths

- Clear pedagogical approach using nervous system analogy
- Comprehensive coverage of installation and verification
- Measurable success criteria with specific percentages and outcomes
- Well-defined scope boundaries
- User scenarios are independently testable

### Ready for `/sp.plan`

This specification provides sufficient detail and clarity to proceed with architecture and implementation planning.
