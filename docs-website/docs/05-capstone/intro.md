# Module 5: Capstone Project

**Applying All Skills to a Real-World Embodied AI Challenge**

The capstone brings together everything learned in Modules 1-4. Students design, build, and deploy a complete autonomous robotic system.

## Learning Objectives

- Integrate ROS 2, simulation, vision, and language models
- Design and execute an end-to-end robotic project
- Validate on real hardware (Unitree Go2 or G1)
- Document and present your work

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Modules 1-4
- Access to Unitree Go2 or G1 robot
- RTX 4070 Ti or Jetson Orin

## Capstone Project Examples

1. **Vision-Guided Navigation**: Robot navigates unknown environment using vision + language understanding
2. **Semantic Manipulation**: Pick and place objects based on language descriptions
3. **Mobile Manipulation**: Combine Go2 mobility with manipulation arm
4. **Collaborative Task Learning**: Teach robot new tasks via demonstration

## Project Timeline

- Week 1-2: Proposal and simulation
- Week 3-4: Real robot development
- Week 5: Integration and validation
- Week 6: Presentation and documentation
