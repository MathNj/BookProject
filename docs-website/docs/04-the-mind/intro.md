# Module 4: The Mind (Vision Language Models & Reasoning)

**Embodied Reasoning and Multi-Modal Understanding**

This advanced module explores how robots can reason about complex scenes, understand language, and make intelligent decisions in dynamic environments.

## Learning Objectives

- Train and fine-tune large vision-language models
- Integrate language reasoning into robot planning
- Implement zero-shot and few-shot learning for new tasks
- Deploy reasoning models efficiently on edge hardware

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Modules 1-3
- Advanced Python/ML knowledge
- RTX 4070 Ti or cloud GPUs for training

## Key Topics

1. **Large Vision-Language Models**: GPT-4V, Gemini, custom VLMs
2. **Fine-Tuning & Adaptation**: Task-specific model adaptation
3. **Prompt Engineering for Robots**: Designing prompts for embodied AI
4. **Multi-Modal Reasoning**: Combining vision, language, and sensor inputs
5. **Real-Time Planning**: LLM-guided robot behavior
