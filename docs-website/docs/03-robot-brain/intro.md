# Module 3: Robot Brain (Isaac Sim & Visual Language Models)

**Perception & Planning for Autonomous Agents**

This module combines Isaac Sim for high-fidelity simulation with Visual Language Models (VLMs) to enable robots to understand visual scenes and plan complex behaviors.

## Learning Objectives

- Train vision-based controllers in Isaac Sim
- Integrate VLMs for scene understanding and task planning
- Deploy real-time inference on Jetson Orin
- Execute navigation and manipulation tasks

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Modules 1-2
- RTX 4070 Ti for training, Jetson Orin for inference
- 64GB RAM recommended

## Key Topics

1. **Vision Transformers**: Architecture and training
2. **Isaac Sim for RL**: Imitation learning and reinforcement learning
3. **Vision Language Models**: CLIP, LLaVA, custom VLMs
4. **Real-Time Inference**: Optimization for edge deployment
5. **Navigation & Manipulation**: End-to-end learning on Go2/G1
